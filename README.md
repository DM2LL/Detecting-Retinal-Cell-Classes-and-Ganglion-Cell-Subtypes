Detecting Retinal Cell Classes and Ganglion Cell Subtypes  Based on Transcriptome Data with Deep Transfer Learning

Purpose:  To  develop  and  assess  the  accuracy  of  deep  learning  models  that  identifies different  retinal  cell  types,  as  well  as  different  retinal  ganglion  cell  (RGC)  subtypes, based on patterns of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in multiple data sets.
